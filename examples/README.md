EXAMPLES
========

These files are examples of how to use swarmkit. They are roughly maintained 
and have some utility in testing changes to swarmkit, but should not be used 
for other purposes. The official, recommended way to use swarmkit is as part of 
Docker's Swarm Mode, which is built into Docker versions 1.12+.
